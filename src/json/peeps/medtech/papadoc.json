When he hit bottom a change came over him and he started his crawl back. Now he's working for Trauma Team as a medic on a response team. He loves the low profile, because of his side business. Papa Doc's biz is into his own tailored made pharms, new and modified cyberwear, and being a ripperdoc. He is willing to do whatever you want done, no questions asked. He has a following from many of the gangs in Night City along with a lot of edgerunners. He is friendly to everyone he meets as long as they're not pointing a weapon in his direction.
